Subject: Panic or segfault in Samba
From: nobody <nobody@sitphp3>

The Samba 'panic action' script, /usr/share/samba/panic-action,
was called for PID 4005 ().

This means there was a problem with the program, such as a segfault.
However, the executable could not be found for process 4005.
It may have died unexpectedly, or you may not have permission to debug
the process.
